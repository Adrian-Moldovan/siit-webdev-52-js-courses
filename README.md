# SIIT WEBFRONTEND-52 JavaScript Sessions

## Session 1

### Part 1 - git

**CLI - command line interface**
A command-line interface (CLI) is a means of interacting with a computer program by inputting lines of text called command-lines. 

**OS commands**
- ls (list): list the current directory
- cd (change directory): change the working directory
- pwd (print working directory): displays the working directory

**Create a new repository on the command line**
- echo "# siit-52-first-repo" >> README.md *(creates a readme markdown file and inserts the text specified between quotes)*
- git init *(initialises a local repository)*
- git add . *(adds files to the next commit. Dot means all files)*
- git commit -m "relevant message" *(creates a new commit)*
- git branch -M main *(renames the current branch to main)*
- git remote add origin https://github.com/user-name/remote-repo.git *(adds a new remote repo)*
- git push -u origin main *(push the commits to the remote repo)*
